devwithGit: A practical, illustrated getting started guide for incorporating git into your workflow. 

The main part of this project is slides.html, a deck js slide presentation for getting into git. The other major resources are visualisations for understanding git in git\_visi and some pedagogical toy version control systems in toy\_vcs. Both are used in the slides. 

Note that this is currently considered alpha level software, there's some inaccuracies in the presentation, some bugs in the visualisations we've used and there's some examples we'd want to add in order to make it complete.
