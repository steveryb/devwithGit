        <p>There're a number of different applications that try to solve this

        <p>Before we examine these individually, we're going to take a brief
        detour and look at what a version control system actually is.</p>
        </div>
        </section>
</section>
<section class="slide">
<h2>What does Version Control software do?</h2>
<p>Take a step back and ask yourself: How would you create as a program to
manage versions of your data?</p>
<p> Ignore everything you've heard about SCM (Source Control Management), just
    think about how you would do it.</p>
<ul>
    <li class=slide><p> What backup features does it have? </p></li>
    <li class=slide><p> How does it store your data? </p></li>
    <li class=slide><p> Where does it store your data? </p></li>
    <ul>
        <li class=slide><p> Where does it store your data on your pc? </p></li>
        <li class=slide><p> Does it store your data on a remote server? If so,
        how?</p></li>
    </ul>
    <li class=slide><p> What's more important: ease of use or efficiency? </p></li>
</ul>
Git, and other VC systems, each answer these questions in their slightly
different ways.

<section class="slide">
  <h2>A possible Chain of Thought</h2>
<p> You may have come up with creative, perhaps even algebraically
  sound systems between the slides, but for our purposes we will guide
  you along a simple path that seems to be a plausible evolution of a
  VCS:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Folder Backup</li>
  <li>Indexed Folder Backup</li>
  <li>Hashed Folder Backup</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>The naive option: Folder Backup</h2>
<p>If you'd never heard of Version Control and you wanted 
                  to make  sure your work was backed up, you'd probably make a 
                  backup folder  somewhere on your drive and simply copy your files 
                  into it
</p>
<p>
This is a form of version control: 
                  you are managing two versions of your data, one in your working 
                  folder and the other a snapshot in a backup folder</p>
<p>If we made a reasonably sophisticated programme to do this, it would probably be able to: </p>
<ul>
    <li class=slide><p> Back your data up into a folder (like .backup) </p></li>
    <li class=slide><p> Restore your data from a folder over your current one</p></li>
</ul>

<h2> Problems with folder backup approach </h2>
<ul>
    <li> There can only be one (backup at a time)! What if you ...</li>
    <ul> 
        <li> realise you made a mistake some time ago and want to revert?</li>
        <li> want to look at why a change was made?</li>
        <li> make a mistake while backing up and lose the working version of your code?</li>

    <h2>Multiple backup folders</h2>
    <p> The version control approach that most sufficiently cautious
    people tend to replicate: copy multiple versions of your data into
    different, numbered folders.</p>
<p>This approach greatly extends the capabilities of the previous 
                  version control software as instead of having only one version to 
                  examine to see how your data is changing, you can now have as 
                  many as you want</p>
    <p>If we made a programme to do this, it should: </p>
    <ul>
        <li class=slide><p> Allow you to make multiple copies of your code in a folder </p></li>
        <li class=slide><p> Restore your code from one of your backups over your current one</p></li>

<h2>Problems with just using multiple folders</h2>

<p> While this is definitely a major improvement over our first version, there are still a number of outstanding issues</p>

<ul>
    <li> It wastes a collosal amount of space </li>
    <ul>      
      <li> Simply renaming a file ensures that it is copied to the
        backup folder when clearly nothing about its content has changed</li>
        <li>By the very nature of file-oriented work, most data is 
              unchanging between backups </li>
        <li> This means that by backing up it's very possible that you
        are creating duplicates of certain files (completed code &amp;c.)</li>
    </ul>
    <li> How would you track changes between iterations or know when
      their contents have changed?</li>
    <li> If you wanted to colloborate with this programme, how would the fact
    that the versions are only numbered relative to your backups impact
    collaboration?</li>
<ul>
<p>
It would seem that these problems all stem from a lack of an
underlying structure. Enter the hashing scheme.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
  <h2> The saviour of our version control endeavour: hashing</h2>
  <p> Otherwise known as the approach that seems obvious in retrospect.</p>
  <p> In order to eliminate file duplication and provide assurance for file
    integrity, we hash every file before it's backed up.</p>
  <p> This also allows very easy sharing: if we wanted to sync our copy with
    a centralised repository, we can simply compare our hashed file listings
    per backup and see where they diverge.</p>
  <p> Note: this is the first version iteration that you can't do manually.
    In order to have the most efficient solution, we have to rely on a program
    doing this for us.</p>

<section class="slide">
<h2> Hashing VCS: Backup and Restoration</h2>
    <p>We would like to implement a programme to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify the validity of the backups:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Hash every file in the backup directory and make sure its hash matches its filename.</p></li>
          <li><p>Make sure every hash listed in the catalogue is present in the backup directory.</p></li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li class=slide><p> Allow you to backup multiple versions of
      your code using the following process: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p> Hash all the files in your directory.</p></li>
            <li><p> Create a catalogue which pairs filenames with their
            hashes - this forms the record of the backup.</p></li>
            <li><p> Backup all files whose hashes aren't already present
            in the backup folder. To make this easier, when backing up make the
            filename the hash.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
    <li class=slide><p> Restore your code from one of your backups by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p> Clear the working directory</p></li>
        <li><p> Loading the catalogue of the relevant backup</p></li>
        <li><p> Copy the files whose hashes are listed in the

<h2>That's all folks!</h2>
<p>That about covers the finer details of implementing a VCS that hashes files, naturally implementing  the mysterious vc class and validating the repo are left as an
  exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>Where to from here?
<p>Where we go from here depends on how we want to answer the 
question depends entirely on how we answer the question "where is the master 
              repository located?". That is, if it resides only on some centralised 
              server then we have invented CVS (centralised version control system), but if everyone is free to keep a 
              copy anywhere, then we have created a DVCS (distributed version control system).</p>
</section>


<section class="slide">
<h2> Centralised VC's </h2>
<p>CVS, Subversion (as used by Amazon) and co.</p>
<ul>

  <li> <p>Centralised version control systems all have, as their defining 
              characteristic, the master copy containing all revision information 
              is located only on the master server on only one machine. Thus, all 
              developers must commit to and pull from it. This introduces a 
              distinct heirarchy of repositories: the central repository is official one, any code that is on your  machine or not in that repository isn't official.</p> </li>  
  <li> <p>The implication of such a system is that anyone who has the data does 
              not actually have the repository, they merely have a copy of the then 
              current version. Thus, in order to acquire past versions and 
              effectively track changes and information one need necessarily be 
              online and connected to the server </p> </li>  
  <li> <p> Finally, most centralised services make it difficult to do
  tasks like branching (covered later).</p> </li>  
</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2> Distributed VC's</h2>
<p>
We'll be focusing on git here, but note that there are a number of different
distributed VCs, such as Darcs and Mecurial. </p>
<ul>
  <li> <p>Decentralised, this means that while there might be centralised
  repositories, when we get the data from that repository we don't get a
  version, we get the whole repository. This is essentially the model we've developed.</p> </li>  
  <li><p> Thus there is no technically privledged repository: anyone
  who gets a copy of a repo has an identical copy to everyone else</p> </li>  
  <li><p>The way git does this is by storing the entire repository, with all
  its backups, hashed in a .git folder stored in the working directory, very
  much like our hashed VCS</p></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2> Internal structure of git </h2>
<p> In fact, git has a lot in common with our little toy hashed vcs structure-wise.
This isn't a course on the interals of git, but to give a brief overview:</p>
<ul>
    <li>It stores all its objects (including files) in one folder with their
    filenames as their SHA1 hashes </li>
    <li> Every time you make a backup, it generates a series of trees, each representing a folder
    being backed up by listing the pairs of the contents of each file along
    with their hash (like our catalogues structure)</li>
    <li> A backup is stored as a commit file which points to the tree
    representing the working directory at the time of backup (exactly like our
    catelogue files)</li>
    <li> Commits are then linked together to provide a history of the
    repository. </li>
</ul>

Although we will not be concerning ourselves with anything finer than the structure of commits from
this point onward, it is worth noting that in three simple
iterations we came up with something that stores data similar to one of the
most popular SCM systems at the moment, an SCM that some call complex!
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>So, what have we achieved?</h2>
    <li><p>We've developed a toy VCS from scratch teaching us a
    couple of important lessons: </p></li>
    <ul>
        <li class=slide><p>Doing VCS manually is as silly as it's inefficient and
        very much lacking in essential features compared to an actual SCM
        system</p></li>
        <li class=slide><p>Every VCS is simply an approach to provide a common
        feature set, they just go about it in a number of different ways.</p></li>
        <li class=slide><p>If we didn't have to waste so much time doing CS
        assignments, we probably would have come up with git by ourselves!</p></li>
    </ul>
    <li class=slide><p>We've learnt about the differnce between centralised and
    distributed version control</p></li>

<h2> Staging: tracked and untracked </h2>
<p> Git has two notions of file monitoring: 
              tracked and untracked. Untracked files are precisely those about 
              which git does not care and which will not be incorporated into any 
              commits or revisions. Tracked files are those that git concerns 
              itself with. To tell git to track a file, we use git add <console>. </p>

<p>
The file is now said to be staged for a commit, that is, git has 
              noted that there are some changes in the file which are not reflected 
              in the current state of the repo up to the last commit and is 
              prepared to record these changes</p>

<p> When staging a file, In particular, git hashes it, compares its hash to the manifest and 
              decides what, if anything, is new about this file

<p>There are a number of reasons why you'd like this level of granularity, e.g. not
commiting large binary files that are automatically created when compiling or
wanting to have some testing data you don't want added to the whole folder.</p>

<div class=git_con>
<span class=git_left>
<p> In order to find out more about the files in your repository, type in git
status. It'll give you the files and directories aren't yet tracked and a
reminder of how to get them to be tracked.</p>
</span>
<span class=git_right><pre class=simple_console>
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Untracked files:
#   test.file
</pre></span>
</div>
<div class=git_con>
<span class=git_left>
<p> To stage a file, we use git add</p>
</span>
<span class=git_right><pre class=simple_console>
$ git status
# On branch master

# Untracked files:

$ git add test.file

<h2> Commit: how to make snapshots </h2>
<p>
Once all the relevant files have been staged what remains is to tell
git that we are ready to bundle up all the changes we have made into
one package - a commit.</p>
<p>
This can be likened to taking a discrete snapshot of the state of the
repo and storing it, so that at any point in the future we may go back
and examine how things were, or branch from a particular state of the
repository and so on. This is the core feature of any VCS.</p>

<p>When taking such a snapshot, we must provide git with a commit message.
This message outlines the reasons for capturing this particular stage,
and any relevant changes that have taken place since the last one.</p>

<p>To do this, we issue git with the 'git commit' command. If there are
no staged files, git will not make a commit. If there are, then git
notes this, and prompts for a message (optionally passed via the -m
flag).</p>

<p>Committing in a repo causes all staged files to return to being merely
tracked and a subsequent git status will report no changes of the files
staged.</p>
<div>
<pre>
$ git status
[ ... ]
# Changes to be committed:
#       new file:   file1
[ ... ]
$ git commit -m "Added file1 to the repo"
[master (root-commit) e71f65b] Added file1 to the repo
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 file1
</pre>
</div>

<p>Commits are used to document important changes in the repo, not just
on the file level but also in so far as branching and merging are
concerned.</p>

<p> Commit guidelines</p>
<ul>
    <li> no whitespace at the start or end </li>
    <li> should be logically distinct: every commit must do something separate
    (rebase if necessary before pushing)</li>
    <li> Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes on first line followed by
    a blank line and longer explanation if neccessary.</li>
</section>

<section id=git_states_slide class="slide">
<h2> Modified and Unmodified files </h2>
<p> We have two last states you'll see if you look at a git status: modified and unmodified. A modified file
has changes that aren't recorded in a past snapshot of the repository while a
unmodified file has no changes that haven't been recored in a snapshot. To commit all modified files, simple plonk git commit -a in.</p>

<p>Let's tie all of these states together:</p>
<div class=left>
    <ul>
        <li id=state_start_repo class=slide>When you start a repository, all
        files are untracked.</li>
        <li id=state_stage_files class=slide>We then stage some files...</li>
        <li id=state_commit_files class=slide>and then we commit. Now some files are tracked and unmodified while
        some are untracked. </li>
        <li id=state_modify_files class=slide>We then work a bit on the project, modifying some of the files</li>
        <li id=state_stage_modified class=slide>We then decide to stage all the modified files along with some of
        the unmodified files.</li>
        <li id=state_commit_modified class=slide>And then commit them all</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class=right>
    <div id=git_states_div></div>
    <pre id=git_console_states></pre>
</div>
</section>

<section class=slide>
<h2>Now that you've got the basics</h2>
<p>... we'll take a quick look at some of the commands and use cases
  you'll be needing in a standard work environment. In particular,
  we'll examine how to<ul>    
    <li>Move/Rename/Remove files</li>
    <li>Tell git to ignore clutter files</li>
    <li>View what has changed between commits</li>
    <li>Automagically commit everything that has changed</li>
    <li>Amend a faulty commit</li>
    <li>Clone/Push/Pull</li>
</ul></p>
</section>

<section class=slide>
  <h2>Tracking moving and deletion</h2>
<p> Clearly, simply deleting or moving a file would be bad for others
  trying to use your repo. While git is fairly clever at working at whether you've moved or deleted a file, it can sometimes fail causing headaches for others trying to make sense of the repo's history</p>

<p> We should tell git to keep track of these
  actions so that it knows when a file is out of the repo or has
  changed name/path. To do this, we call git mv when moving a tracked file and git rm when we want to delete one </p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Ignorance is bliss</h2>
<p> Sometimes compiling files in the working directory can generate a
  whole bunch of 'garbage' (*.o, *.hi, *.pyc ...) which you don't want
  to feature in the repo (after all, everyone can build things for
  themselves). Perhaps there are just some files which you are using
  for testing, but which shouldn't be registered as untracked in any
  event.</p>
<span class=git_con>
  <pre class=simple_console>
    $ ls
    junk.o amazing.hi debug.pyc temporary_db.sql [...]
    $ git status
    # On branch master
    # Untracked files:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    #
    #       junk.o amazing.hi debug.pyc temporary_db.sql [...]
    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add"
    to track)
</pre></span>
</section>

<section class=slide>
<h2>Ignorance is bliss</h2>
<p>How do we get git to ensure that such files are forever untracked
  and invisible to it?</p>
<p class=slide>Why, gitignore is the answer! In specific, there are two files that
  are of importance: '.git/info/exclude' and '.gitignore'</p>
<p class=slide>In particular, the exclude file tells git to apply those
  rules to any file in the tree, anywhere, whereas .gitignore applies
  only to the directory in which it is located (and its subdirs).</p>
<span class=slide>
<p>There is a lot to be said about the pattern matching
  capabilites (see 'git help gitignore') but for now, learn by example
  <span class=git_con>
    <pre class=simple_console>
      $ cat Docs/.gitignore
      # We don't want to track any of the generated html files
      *.html
      # Execpt ilikecats.html, which we do update by hand
      !ilikecats.html

      $ cat .git/info/exclude
      # No object files
      *.[od]
      # and stop python from polluting our world
      *.pyc
</pre></span></p></span></section>

<section class=slide>
<h2>What difference does it make?</h2>
<p>Now that we are only tracking files we care about, our structure is
  a lot cleaner. But suppose a commit is made and you patch up some
  files, forget to commit and come back a week later (because it is an
  indie project) and you cannot remember what you changed and
  where.</p>
<p class=slide>Git to the rescue! 'git diff &lt;commit&gt; [&lt;commit&gt;]' is
  what you seek, it will give you a diff between the current
  tracked changes and a particular commit or between any two such
  commits</p>
<span class=slide>
 <span class=git_con>
   <pre class=simple_console>
     $ emacs cars
     $ git add cars
     $ emacs cars
     $ git diff
     diff --git a/cars b/cars
     index 72a265c..d66ec78 100644
     --- a/cars
     +++ b/cars
     @@ -1 +1,2 @@
     This is highly irrelevant
     +Now this is more relevant
 </pre></span>
</span>
<p class=slide> Although this can be somewhat hard to read, the basic idea here is
  that the contents of 'cars' changed by the removal of one line, and
  the addition of another, where the line that was removed is
  displayed first and the new line is prefixed by +.</p>
</section>

<section class=slide>
<h2>History is not set in stone</h2>
<p>The scenario is easy to grasp and probably more common than we dare
  concede: You've just completed all your work, everything is working
  and now it's time to roll out the new revision. You git add your
  files and commit. Boom. Time to relax. A quick check of 'git log
  --summary' and you notice something. Oh no, you've left out
  'critical_file.c'. Oh dear.</p>
<p class=slide>Perhaps you could just add another commit to say 'I
  forgot these files, um, sorry' but this isn't always desirable and
  it may annoy your repo-controlling overlords (see
  later). Furthermore, your mistake could have been as trivial as an
  incomplete commit message -- what then? To that
  end, git offers you recourse through 'git commit --amend'.</p>
<p class=slide>Put simply, this command simply re-purposes the last
  commit to include all staged files and allows you to include
  potentially critical information in the commit message.</p>

<h2>Attack of the clones</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, cloning a repo is one of the inherent
  strengths that a DVCS has. Anyone who clones a repo has it in its
  entirety, and can review and meddle with all the changes made to it
  by anyone.</p>
<p class=slide>Suppose now that you have successfully cloned a repo,
  and using the above-discussed arsenal, worked on it and have a bunch
  of commits done and ready to be unleashed unto the world.</p>
<p class=slide>Enter git push. It takes your repo and, assuming you
  have rights to the server, puts your changes on the server.</p>
<span class=slide>
 <span class=git_con>
   <pre class=simple_console>
     $ git commit -m "It's all done now."
     [master a99495e] It's all done now

 </pre></span>
 <p class=slide>What could possibly go wrong?<ul>
     <li class=slide>You do not have push rights - git will tell you politely</li>
     <li class=slide>Your local copy is out-of-sync with the
       server. To rectify this see pulling and merging.</li>
 </ul></p>
</section>

<section class=slide>
<h2>Pulling your weight</h2>
<p>There are two important times when you would need your repo to
  catch-up to the server/master repo.<ul>
    <li class=slide>Important work upon which you depend has occured
      elsewhere and you wish to be up-to-date with it</li>
    <li class=slide>You have done some work and wish to push your
    changes but cannot because other changes have occured elsewhere
      and are now on the server</li></ul></p>
<p class=slide> The first case is easy to handle. Merely run 'git
  pull' and all the changes will be downloaded to your repo and merged
  (though this is not guaranteed to be problem free)</p>
<p class=slide>The second case begins in the same way, but comes with
  the high probability that you will need to manually merge files. In
  particular, when you pull because you wish to push your changes but
  cannot, all of the changes you do not have are downloaded into your
  local repo. In fact, there will be two 'branches' (think of them as
  concurrently existing versions of the content) sitting in your local
  repo.</p>
<p class=slide>If you wish to unify your changes with the changes from
  elsewhere - and thus be able to push - you must merge these two
  branches (more on this later). In principle, you need to tell git to
  combine the work done elsewhere with your current work and commit
  that change to your repo so that there is only one version which
  represents the work done on both.</p>
  <span class=slide>
    <span class=git_con>
      <pre class=simple_console>
        $ git pull
        [ ... ]
        $ git commit -m "Merge of work from local/master and origin/master"
        $ git push
  </pre></span></span>
</section>

<section class=slide>
<h2>While we're on the topic</h2>
<p>Branches are a fundamental component of a successful git
  workflow. They allow you to simultaneosly persue different avenues
  and maintain concurrent, incompatible or decidedly separate versions
  of your content (say, a testing and stable version) while being able
  to merge the one into the other when appropriate.</p>
<p class=slide>It has been suggestively named, and so should be
  imagined as a literal branch in the timeline of changes that runs
  concurrently.</p>
<p class=slide>The basic tools of the trade for branching
  are <ul><li class=slide>git branch [&lt;new_branch_name&gt;]</li>
    <li class=slide>git checkout &lt;branch&gt;</li>
    <li class=slide>git merge &lt;branch&gt;</li></ul></p>
</section>

<section class=slide>
<h2>Branch</h2>
<p>The first port of call is that of 'git branch'</p>
  <span class=slide>
    <span class=git_con>
      <pre class=simple_console>
        $ git branch
        * master
  </pre></span></span>
<p class=slide>Without any arguments, it merely informs you of all the
  branches contained in the repo. However, if we provide it with an
  argument, it forms a branch in the timeline of changes under that
  name</p>
<p class=slide>In actuality, virtually everything you would like to
  achieve in so far as manipulating branches is concenrned, is done
  through the branch command:<ul>
    <li class=slide>Rename the current branch: git branch -m &lt;name&gt;</li>
    <li class=slide>Safe delete the current branch: git branch -d &lt;branch&gt;
      <ul>
        <li class=slide>Git considers it safe to remove a branch only
        when there are no outstanding merges. That is, only if its
          content exists elsewhere.</li>
        <li class=slide>You'll see a polite error message informing
          you that there is content yet to be merged</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li class=slide>Force delete (ye be warned): git branch -D &lt;branch&gt;</li>
    <li class=slide>Gain insight into the structure and coherence of
    your branches:<ul>
        <li class=slide>You may wish to know precisely which branches
        are in-step with the branch you are currently working on
        (those that do not depend on changes which have not been made
        in your branch) or which branches are within reach of a
          particular commit. To this end: git branch --merged
        [&lt;commit&gt;]</li>
        <li class=slide>The complement of this piece of information is
        oftentimes also useful (when merging, care needs to be taken
        with all branches which are not so aligned), thus there is:
          git branch --no-merged</li></ul></li></ul></p>
</section>

<section class=slide>
<h2>Checkout</h2>
<p>Using 'git checkout' we can effectively change universes and work
  within the safe environment of our branch. Here, any changes that we
  make and commit effect only this branch and not our original
  timeline.</p>
<p class=slide>To that end, we are free to muck things up, perfect
  concepts or just generally persue other avenues or test features
  before they become part of the main body</p>
<p class=slide>Git takes care of managing all the relevant files and
  directories for us, if something is part of master, and we checkout
  to experimental, it will no longer appear in a directory
  listing.</p>
<p class=slide>We may maintain arbitrarily many distinct working
  environments in such a set-up</p>
</section>

<section class=slide>
<h2>Merge</h2>
<p>Possibly the most complex (not <i>complicated</i>) part of managing
  a git repo: combining branches.</p>
<p class=slide>The basic command is 'git merge &lt;branch&gt;'. This
  will merge 'branch' into the current branch and automagically settle
  some rather complex under-the-hood things.
<p class=slide>There are two scenarios: a fast-forward merge and a
  three-way merge; git will do different things in each case. The only
  thing to take away from this is, if you want a commit to be
  generated every time you merge use the '--no-ff' flag when
  merging</p>
 <span class=slide>
    <span class=git_con>
      <pre class=simple_console>
        $ git merge experiments
        [ ... ]
        Auto-merging slides.html
        CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in slides.html
        Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the
        result.
        $ git status
        [ ... ]
        # Both modified: slides.html
 </pre></span></span>
 <p class=slide>Sometimes this may happen to you, when you pull or
 when you merge. All git is saying is that the branches your are
 playing with have made potentially conflicting changes to the same
   file and it's not sure how to proceed.</p>
 <p class=slide>At this point, you should fire up your favourite
 editor and manually check the file in question. Git will neatly mark
 which bits came from what branch and it's up to you to choose the
 right ones.
 </p><p class=slide>Once done, commit your changes and the branches
    have been successfully merged!</p>
</section>

<section class=slide>
<h2>Altogether now</h2>
<div class=left><ul>
  <li class=slide id=branch_start_repo>Before we branch, we have some
  timeline representing the state of the repo</li>
  <li class=slide id=branch_first_branch>Branching introduces an
  alternate stream in which we may work, but does not move the head
    pointer to this state</li>
  <li class=slide id=branch_checkout_branch>By calling checkout we
  effectively switch to our parallel universe, git takes care of all
    the files which do or do not exist and the heead pointer is
  moved</li>
  <li class=slide id=branch_commit>We may then freely work in this
    branch without fear of upsetting our other work</li>
  <li class=slide id=branch_merge>If we wish to merge the features in
    the experimental branch, we switch to our main branch and call git
    merge</li>
  <li class=slide id=branch_delete>Now that we have merged our
    features, we may safely delete the experimental branch without git
    complaining. This is known as a fast forward merge as the master is an ancestor of the branch being merged which means we can simply move it up.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class=right>
    <div id=git_branch_tree_div></div>
</div>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2> Merging: a visual example </h2>
<div class=left><ul>
  <li class=slide id=merge_start_repo>Here we have a basic branch structure similar to what we have before.</li>
  <li class=slide id=merge_branch>We decide we want to add some experimental features, so we add a testing branch and switch to it.</li>

  <li class=slide> To try and placate our testy supervisor, we decide to merge some of the awesome testing features into our master branch, giving us a repo that looks like...</li>
  <li class=slide id=merge_merge>...this, with the merge of the two branches becoming its own commit. This is called a three way merge and it is made based on the latest common ancestor the branches being merged share.</li>

    <div id=git_merge_tree_div></div>
</div>
</section>

<section class=slide>
<h2>Overall then</h2>
<p> We have seen how to use the basic building of git to create a repo
  and populate it, clone one and meddle in it, and push and pull
  changes</p>
<p class=slide>On top of this structure, we imposed a higher level
  wherein all of this could easily happen inside a branch of project
  and happily remain disjoint until such a time that it was ready to
  be merged with the main stream</p>
<p class=slide>All that remains is to chat about the most interesting
  concept, rebase, before a brief foray into workflow and actually <i>using</i> git.
</section>

<section class=slide>
<h2>Rebase or why you would opaquely change the past</h2>
<p>Suppose the following situation occurs:<ul>
    <li class=slide>You branch your a remote repo and happily hack
      away at it</li>
    <li class=slide>Upstream changes occur, and you decide to pull
    them in. 'No worries', you think, 'I have all my work in another
      branch. I can pull without conflict'. You do so.</li>
    <li class=slide>There are some really interesting changes made in
    the master branch, and you think to yourself that it would be
      wonderful to have those in your branch.</li>
    <li class=slide>How could you do this? Well, you could perform a
    (three-way) merge between your branch and the master one, generate
      a superfluous commit in the timeline and then proceed.</li>
</ul></p>
<p class=slide>Surely there is a better way to do this? Rebase is the
  'better' way. Instead of that last step, git rebase &lt;base&gt;
  (where base is anything that would pass-up as a reference to a
  particular point in the timeline of the project) takes your entire
  branch, subtly changes the files within it to be up-to-speed with
  the desired branch and then applies your commits to those files and
  finally pretends as though the whole thing never
  happened. Yes. That's right.</p>
<p class=slide>There will be no trace whatsoever that you branched off
  at some earlier point then current records indicate and your branch
  will be ahead of the branch from which it came, generating a nice,
  linear flow.</p>
<p class=slide>Rebasing is your way of saying 'Git, I want my branch
  to be based on the work that everyone else has already done to
  branch x'</p></section>

<section class="slide">
<h2> Rebasing: a visual example </h2>
<div class=left><ul>
  <li class=slide id=rebase_start_repo>Here we have a similar situation to the
  previous merging example: we have two branches with changes that we want to
  put together. If we don't mind complexity, merging is a way to go. But if we
  want a nice linear order, we can do something a bit different</li>
  <li class=slide>We're going to perform a rebase of Test onto Master:</li>
  <li class=slide id=rebase_rebase>Here we can see that instead of having a
  messy structure as before, we have one linear line. Note that c4' is a
  completely different commit than c4; it's c4 with all the changes from c3
  patched onto it. </li>
  <li class=slide id=rebase_update>We can now just do a fast forward
  merge on master and we're done.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class=right>
    <div id=git_rebase_tree_div></div>
</div>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2> Workflow </h2>
<p> Since git is distributed, there's a multitude of different workflows. A
good outline of these is <a
    href=http://git-scm.com/book/en/Distributed-Git>Pro Git by Scott Chacon</a>
available free online at the link.</p>

<p> We'll just cover briefly the model that is commonly used for small teams.</p>

<ul>
    <li> You all commit to a central repository with the master branch being a
    stable version</li>
    <li> However, all work you do for a feature is on a separate branch. For
    example, if you were working on a game there'd be a branch for adding AI, a
    branch for working on game logic, another for collision detection and so
    on.</li>
    <li> When a feature is complete, you notify the branch manager that you
    want to merge. They then test it and, if satisfied, merge it into the main
    branch which then becomes the base for all other work.</li>
    <li> If when testing a bug appears in the master branch, you create a bug
    fix branch (e.g. hotfix1), fix the problem and then merge the changes back
    in.</li>
</ul>

<p>The advantages of this model is that you always have a clear division between
future features and currently functionality giving you the flexibility to try
new things without having the uncertainty and instability that having everyone
changing the main branch would create.</p>

<p>Often this model is a bit more complex in that every developer uses a
different repository rather than branch, but the general pattern is the same.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Congratulations!  </h2>
<p>You now have a decent idea of how git works. For the rest of the workshop we're going to practice using it.</p>

<ul>
    <li> First, you're going to do some individual tasks in order to get some
    fluency in using git.</li>
    <li> Everyone is then going to get into small groups and get used to
    colloborating using git!</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide">
	<h1>Using git colloboratively</h1>
</section>

<section class="slide"><h1>Interactive session</h1></section>

<section class="slide">
  <h2>Your first task</h2>
  <p>Now that you have some non-zero understanding of git, it's time
  to put it to the test and actually <i>use</i> git to achieve
    something.</p>
<p class="slide"> While the emphasis has been on managing code, git is actually a
  DVCS where V is for version and not code. Thus, we are going to
  forgo the coding idea for this exercise.</p>
<p class="slide"> Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to: <ul>
    <li class="slide"> Create a github account if you do not have one already</li>
    <li class="slide"> Set up a repo for this exercise, call it 'first_test' or some
    such</li>
    <li class="slide"> Write a brief <i>html</i> page about using the basic
      functionality of git</li>
    <li class="slide"> Use git to facilitate regular revisions of this file and all
      associated files (pictures, css ...)</li></ul>
</p>
<p class="slide"> At the conclusion of the session, pull other people's repos and
  see if they noted some things you overlooked or visa versa.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Your second task</h2>
<p>This is the large project of the day. You will be collaborating in
  groups of three to create something you will ultimately be one of
  proud or ashamed of in the near future</p>
<p class="slide"> The emphasis of this exercise is very much a
  collaborative and distributed workflow. Each member will be
  tackeling distinct but related parts of the project, and it's vital
  that the effort is coordinated. However, you will all be working on
  different machines and so you must make full use of git!</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Your second task</h2>
<p>To make the exercise even more useful, you will be working in the
  benevolent dictator model.</p>
<p class="slide">Each group will be assigned a tutor, and they will
  have access to the repo. You will need to submit patches and push
  requests to your overlord in order to contribute -- make local
  branches, stash things, be wise: too many requests can anger your betters!</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Your second task</h2>
<p>'What is this project?' I hear you scream.</p>
<p class="slide">You will be making a text adventure game.</p>
<p class="slide">A natural distribution of labour would have one
  person writing the engine, another the script, and the last working
  on the interface.</p>
<p class="slide">What sort of features do we expect?<ul>
    <li class="slide">Read a script from an external file in some
    format</li>
    <li class="slide">Allow for a player inventory, conditional
    decisions, random events, perhaps even a rudementary way to code
      while loops in the script, generic enough to play a wide variety of games,
      perhaps dynamic player statistics or win conditions</li>
    <li class="slide">Clear and easy to use interface with appropriate
    information displayed on-screen, help and suggestions easily accessible
    <li class="slide">A fun example game</li></ul></p>
<p class="slide">See our <b>example</b></a></p>
